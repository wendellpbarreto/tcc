\noindent The way that the organizations and institutions depend on information systems to leverage your performance and excel in the market is remarkable. Given the information technology studies, solutions are developed with a focus on optimizing and improving processes. And given these needs, this paper proposes a software solution that seeks to optimize the process of creating materials in the Digital Metropolis Institute materials production sector, supplementary unit of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. Through this proposal, the case study will be conducted to raise the requirements for the development, and validate them with the stakeholders, thereby ensuring that the proposed software model meets the demands of users.

\noindent\textit{Keywords}: information system, development, process, materials.
